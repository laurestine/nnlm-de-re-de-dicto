# Big NNLMs and De Re / De Dicto Distinction
A repository for a project investigating NNLM sensitivity to the De Re / De Dicto distinction.

All code for the project is in the code directory. In order to run the project, you will need to download the files from [RoBERTa finetuned for the Winograd Schema Challenge on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/roberta-large-finetuned-wsc), and add them to the `input/roberta-finetuned-for-wsc` directory along with the `merges.txt` file already present. After that, the code should be able to run unassisted. In particular, we've included the code that generates our test data, and we've split processing the data with RoBERTa into four chunks which can be commented out separately.

The generated data is also available in the parent directory, if you'd rather investigate the patterns without running the code. Note that you may wish to comment out parts of the code to avoid redundancy.

The `input/winograd` directory contains the exact files available at [the SuperGLUE Benchmark website](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/tasks) under "WSC", as of the time of creation of this project (March 22, 2022). The `input/roberta-finetuned-for-wsc/merges.txt` file was downloaded from [The RoBERTa-large HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large). The other files in `input/` are generated by the authors of the present project.
